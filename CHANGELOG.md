# Changelog

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-25

### Changed (D22 — an agent fire that would execute nothing is refused)
- **Behavior change (pre-1.0 minor).** An agent-sourced `fire()` of a declared-but-UNBOUND tool now
  returns the typed rejection `NOT_MATERIALIZED` instead of a success-shaped no-op (and, for a
  `goTo` tool, silently moving the cursor). Reported from a live agent: in guide mode the model was
  told `{ ok: true, settlement: 'settled' }`, reported "successfully created the project…", and the
  real app had never moved. The library now enforces its own README rule, fail-closed — the
  `guardUnevaluated` stance applied to actuation: never launder a claim as a fact.
  The app self-report tier is untouched: `source: 'user' | 'system'` and the record-only
  `invoke: false` sensor still pass (that motion really happened), and a mid-mount node still
  answers the retriable `STILL_MOUNTING`. Every port inherits the gate from the one chokepoint
  (Mode B `skillsAsTools`, the MCP server, direct `fire()`, `hcifootprint/testing`).
- **Upgrade note.** Three public unions widen, so an exhaustive `switch` gains a case and stops
  compiling until you add it: `FireResult` rejection reasons gain `'NOT_MATERIALIZED'`, and
  `GapRecord.kind` / `GapRecord.rejectionReason` gain `'unmaterialized-fire'` / `'NOT_MATERIALIZED'`.
  Gap-stream volume changes too: `gaps()` and `onGap` now carry a row for every unbound agent fire
  that previously returned success-shaped and left no trace.

### Added (D22)
- `allowUnmaterializedFires` session option (`createSession`) — honest touring for guide/tour/plan
  flows: the no-op fire proceeds and says so. The result carries `executed: false` +
  `materialized: false`, the transition is stamped `materialized: false`, `contextBrief()` renders
  `not materialized — nothing executed`, every served edge (and Mode B `readySteps` / `whats_here`
  action) is stamped `materialized: false` before it is fired, and each no-op lands a gap-ledger row
  of the new `kind: 'unmaterialized-fire'` — the binding still to build, clustered with the rest of
  the demand backlog.
- `toNodeClaimed: true` is now disclosed on Mode B fire results whenever the cursor moved on an
  edge's declared `goTo`. The flag existed internally (on the transition, and in the context brief)
  but never rode the result, so a claimed navigation could diverge from the real app silently. Docs
  gain the consumer rule: **re-`sync()` after any claimed navigation** (a bound handler completing
  does not confirm navigation either — only `sync()` does).
- `TransitionRecord.materialized`, `FireResult.executed` / `FireResult.materialized`, the
  `NOT_MATERIALIZED` rejection reason (also on `GapRecord.rejectionReason`), and the
  `'unmaterialized-fire'` gap kind. See `docs/design/d22-materialized-fires.md`.

### Added (D21 — receipts on the high-effect ask, and decisions that leave a record)
- The `needs-confirm` result now carries `receipts` (`ConfirmReceipts`) — `willDo` (edge
  description + declared, honesty-tagged effect), `because` (the guard evidence that made the
  edge fireable — KNOWN, not scored), `youAreOn`/`version`, and `recentSteps` (the fire-journal
  tail) — assembled from what the session already knows, so an agent can SHOW the human what
  they are approving. Rides `doStep`/`doAction`/MCP as plain JSON.
- A confirm journal: `session.confirmAsk(id)`, `session.declineConfirm(id, {by?, note?})`,
  `session.confirms()`, `session.onConfirm(fn)`, and the `'confirm'` observer event — the
  auditable ask → decision → fire chain. A confirmed `fire()` auto-closes its ask as `approved`
  and stamps `TransitionRecord.askId`. Kept SEPARATE from the gap ledger (a gated action is
  consented capability, not unmet demand).
- Mode B: a `decline: true` arg on the skill-tool / `do_action` call records the human's refusal
  (returns `judgment: 'declined'`) instead of the ask dangling — symmetric with `confirm: true`,
  added to the static input schema (a one-time pre-1.0 schema bump).
- Field kinship with agentfootprint's `checkIn` evidence is deliberate (one mental model across
  both libraries); nothing is imported across — the one substantive divergence is `because`
  (KNOWN guard evidence) vs `drivers` (a scored guess). See `docs/design/d21-confirm-receipts.md`.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-19

First npm release (previously git-install only).

### Added
- `requiredStateKeys()` on both graph types (`SkillGraph` and `NavigationGraph`) — the
  sorted set of state keys every guard reads, so a projector can be seeded completely
  (an unseeded key is served with the `guardUnevaluated` honesty marker, not hidden).
- `whats_here { sinceVersion }` — Mode B replies can narrate only the delta since the
  model's last look; a fixed `why` tool serves the causal backward slice for a state key.
- `llms.txt` — a single, source-verified API page for agent (and human) consumers.
- README: guard-semantics section, the adoption ladder (guide mode blessed as Phase 0),
  and the Mode B settlement re-read rule.

### Fixed
- Git installs now build themselves (`prepare` script) — `npm i github:footprintjs/hcifootprint`
  ships a working `dist/`.
- `undefined` is never stored: a report entry whose value is `undefined` is dropped, and a
  declared write reported as `undefined` counts as missing; a key holding `undefined` is as
  unevaluable as an absent one.
- Subpath exports (`/mcp`, `/testing`, `/testing/lint`) resolve under node10 typing
  (`typesVersions`); attw + publint clean.
