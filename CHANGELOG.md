# Changelog

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-19

First npm release (previously git-install only).

### Added
- `requiredStateKeys()` on both graph types (`SkillGraph` and `NavigationGraph`) — the
  sorted set of state keys every guard reads, so a projector can be seeded completely
  (an unseeded key is served with the `guardUnevaluated` honesty marker, not hidden).
- `whats_here { sinceVersion }` — Mode B replies can narrate only the delta since the
  model's last look; a fixed `why` tool serves the causal backward slice for a state key.
- `llms.txt` — a single, source-verified API page for agent (and human) consumers.
- README: guard-semantics section, the adoption ladder (guide mode blessed as Phase 0),
  and the Mode B settlement re-read rule.

### Fixed
- Git installs now build themselves (`prepare` script) — `npm i github:footprintjs/hcifootprint`
  ships a working `dist/`.
- `undefined` is never stored: a report entry whose value is `undefined` is dropped, and a
  declared write reported as `undefined` counts as missing; a key holding `undefined` is as
  unevaluable as an absent one.
- Subpath exports (`/mcp`, `/testing`, `/testing/lint`) resolve under node10 typing
  (`typesVersions`); attw + publint clean.
